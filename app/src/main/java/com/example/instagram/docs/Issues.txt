1.  Bottom Navigation View tab_change_error
    - crash
    - action doesn't exist

2.  Profile destination
    - VP.saveState = false


TODOO:

1. Custom RV to send touch input to child, until a specific view is not at top.
2. Get the height of device screen at runtime (returns 0){another approach to solve above problem}
3. Picture cropping as 4:5 but didn't got satisfactory results.
4. Tapping navigation destination again should pop out all the transaction on that specific tab.
5. Assigning default value at runtime to a destination in navigation graph.
